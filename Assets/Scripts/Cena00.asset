  dialog: "$name: Come on, $boyfriend, we have to go!\r\n$boyfriend: I haven't finished
    packing yet! Did you get the radio?\r\n$name: I might have forgotten.\r\n$boyfriend:
    Did you want us to go an entire road trip without listening to $band at least
    once?\r\n$name: Wouldn't dream of it.\r\n\r\nYou pack your essentials, and, of
    course, your radio. Once $boyfriend is out of the room, you hide something very
    important, a wedding ring carefully tucked inside an acorn shaped box. He has
    wanted to visit Londrina for a long time now. You have done your homework, there's
    plenty of beautiful places for a proposal to take place. You picture the both
    of you at Lake Igap\xF3, $boyfriend watching the sunset, while you take out the
    ring and wait for him to look at you. He will turn around to badmouth a swan
    swimming in the lake, but as soon as he lays eyes upon you, he tears up. It's
    gonna be perfect!"
